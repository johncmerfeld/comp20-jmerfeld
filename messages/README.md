Lab 7: Messages

This script loads messages from a server and displays them in the messages div. It is a jQuery implementation of a problem we previously tackled in javascript. Ming said it could be done in 9 lines, which mine COULD do, but for aesthetic reasons I defined the url as its own variable, so my code is 10 lines long.

Worked for about an hour on Sunday to implement.

CITATIONS:
- Used Ming's example code for the syntax of what to do with the html in the div.

- consulted stack exchange on changing contents of a div with jQuery: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7139208/change-content-of-div-jquery

- consulted jQuery documentation on get()
