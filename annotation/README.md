EPIC FAIL:

Using Ming's HTML, my own CSS and JS to annotate the accompanying video (not yet implemented)

HTML file links to separate JavaScript file for readability.

Style sheet mostly ported from my personal webpage with added support / tinkering for the video.

Tested event listening code from the Mozilla page but replaced with my own for final version
