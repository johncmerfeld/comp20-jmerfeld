Security evaluation for Ming's black car service

This is an HTML page detailing the findings of my security evaluation of Ming's app from assignment 3. In it I outline three problems I discovered and how they might be dealt with.

I worked on this assignment alone, and my references can be found on the page itself.

I spent about 5 hours on this assignment on Monday and Tuesday.
