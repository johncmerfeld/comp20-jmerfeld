Private web development repository

- What is this purpose of this Git repository?

This repository is a collection of web development projects I have worked on for COMP 20 at Tufts University. The work contained here covers my first projects creating client- and server-side content and includes documents written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using various tools and libraries including jQuery, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

- What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

Assignment 2 was definitely my favorite. I think it was the project where I felt the best balanced between being seriously challenged and genuinely knowing what I was doing. Assignment 1 was a lot of fun but I figured it out fairly quickly, whereas assignment 3 was very challenging and I never totally felt like I completely mastered it. Assignment 2 felt like I really conquered the material from start to finish and was totally happy with my end product. It was extremely fun to make.

- How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I feel like I've grown quite a lot, and can now have a cogent conversation about how the internet works. I'd say that's been my biggest takeaway from the class: the internet isn't magic, but it's still pretty complicated. It's made me think a lot more every time I use the web or any other internet application. How does this work? What information is coming from the client vs. the server? The class has definitely taught me to ask the right questions and know how to start answering them.

- What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

Learning about APIs and how much of web development is building on existing frameworks was really important. Interacting with the Google or Facebook API has taught me a lot about how many of the things I use every day actually work.

I would also say learning about asynchronous JavaScript was also one of the most important "how everything works" moments for me. Seeing how a language can be event-driven instead of simply running a script really opened my eyes about the internet.

- Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I definitely want to look more into databases and using the web to gather, store, parse, and visualize information.

I also want to start writing a science blog and doing all the styling myself and really make it look and feel cool without relying on a front-end framework.
